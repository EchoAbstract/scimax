*************** TODO Review                                        :jkitchin:
Do not remove this. It is here so this shows up in my agenda as an item to do.

*************** TODO Create a bibtex file
Click on this to create a file:references.bib.

Put 5-10 references in this file. I recommend you do this with M-x doi-add-bibtex-entry for scientific papers.  Books are best done manually at this point.
