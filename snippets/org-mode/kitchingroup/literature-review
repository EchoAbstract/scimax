*************** TODO Create a bibtex file
Click on this to create a file:references.bib.

Put 5-10 references in this file. I recommend you do this with M-x doi-add-bibtex-entry for scientific papers.  Books are best done manually at this point.
*************** END



* build                                                            :noexport:

Export this file to a pdf with C-c C-e lo. or this link:

[[elisp:(org-open-file (org-latex-export-to-pdf))]]

Make sure the file builds into a nice looking PDF.

* Submit

Run this code block to commit and submit your report. Note that this will add everything in this directory, so do not do this if you have a lot of files

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# 10 MB max report size
MAXSIZE="10485760"
CHECK="\`du -s . | awk '{print \$1}'\`"

if [ "$MAXSIZE" -gt "$CHECK" ]; then
    git add *
    git commit -am "Automated commit"
    git push
else
    echo "This directory is too big. Please see Prof. Kitchin" 1>&2
    exit 1
fi
#+END_SRC

You can also use elisp:magit-status to add, commit and push the files.

a - will add a file
s - will stage a file
cc - will commit a set of changes, enter your message and type C-cC-c
Pp - will push to the remote repo

Either way, don't forget to send Prof. Kitchin an email that you have submitted the report and it is ready for review. Then, wait for feed back from him for you to review. You should try to not modify the repo until then to keep things simple.

Then run this block to pull the changes back for you to review.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(shell-command "git pull")
(revert-buffer)
(goto-char (point-min))
#+END_SRC

If you run into any problems, please see Prof. Kitchin.
